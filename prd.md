7. Technology Stack

    Backend Framework: Django (Python)

    Frontend Styling: Tailwind CSS

    Database: SQLite (Django default)

    Web Server: Nginx

    App Routing: Handled by Django's URL routing system.

    Version Control: Git / GitHub / GitLab

    (Optional) Asynchronous Task Queue: Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ (for handling background tasks like sending emails)

8. System Architecture (High-Level)

The system will follow Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture:

    Models: Define the data structure and interact with the database.

    Views: Contain the business logic, process requests, and interact with models and templates.

    Templates: Handle the presentation layer, rendering HTML that is styled with Tailwind CSS.
    Django's built-in ORM will be used for database interactions. Django's URL dispatcher will manage app routing.

9. User Stories (Examples)

    Customer:

        "As a new customer, I want to easily register for an account so I can save my order preferences and view my history."

        "As a customer, I want to browse a visually appealing menu with clear item descriptions and prices so I can make informed choices."

        "As a customer, I want to add items to my cart and easily adjust quantities or remove items before I confirm my order."

        "As a customer, I want to select a date and time for my catering reservation and provide delivery details smoothly."

        "As a customer, I want to view my past orders so I can quickly reorder or remember what I previously purchased."

        "As a customer, I want to provide a star rating and a short review for my catering experience to help others and provide feedback to the business."

    Admin (Staff):

        "As an admin, I want to securely log in to the administrative panel to manage the catering system."

        "As an admin, I want to add new dishes to the menu with all necessary details like name, description, price, and images."

        "As an admin, I want to quickly view and update the status of customer orders (e.g., from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed')."

        "As an admin, I want to see all customer ratings and comments in one place so I can understand customer satisfaction levels."

        "As an admin, I want to view a summary of transactions over a specific period to track sales performance."
